# Copy with File Name

**Copy with File Name** is a powerful and customizable VS Code extension that enhances the default copy behavior. When you copy selected code, it prepends or appends a comment showing the file name (or full path), making your shared snippets more informative.

---

## Features

- Prepend or append file name (or full path) to copied text
- Automatically detects and uses correct comment syntax based on file type
- Optional custom comment prefix/suffix
- Configurable output format:
  - Use full path or file name only
  - Add blank line after header
  - Place header before or after selected code
- Override comment styles for specific languages

---

## Usage

1. Select any portion of code in the editor
2. Run the command:
   - Via Command Palette: `Copy with File Name`
   - Or use the shortcut: `Ctrl+Shift+C` (customizable)

The selected code will be copied to your clipboard with the file name as a comment.

## Example Output

**Python**

```python
# File: my_script.py

print("Hello, world!")
```

**HTML**

```html
<!-- File: index.html -->
<div>Hello</div>
```

**C++**

```
